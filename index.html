            <p class="verse">
                She used to be a fragile baby in a golden place<br>
                But now it seems her acid visions have come and changed that face</p>
            <p class="chorus">
                She says I'm hallucinating<br>
                Queen in my pictures</p>

            <p class="verse">
                She's drawing demon clusters on her stucco walls<br>
                And hanging all her clothing from her mother's ceiling</p>

            <p class="chorus">
                Now I'm hallucinating<br>
                Queen in my pictures</p>

            <p class="verse">
                All the handsome fellas used to want to hold her hand<br>
                But now she's finding it hard to find a loving man</p>

            <p class="chorus">
                I'm hallucinating<br>
                Queen in my pictures</p>

            <p class="verse">
                I met her recently upon a swollen Nile<br>
                She spoke to me in her disconnected rhyme</p>
            <p class="chorus">
                I'm hallucinating<br>
                Queen in my pictures</p>
